    "- TESTING! Testing is very important because backend is very fragile. It can work for one minute and then doing one thing could stop it from working the way you want. Use local servers or the group server to test. Make sure to test a lot.\n",
    "- Going over your work is also very important. This is because you could have one single small mistake that may not change much, but you always want your code to be at its full potential and keeping a small mistake that is easy fix doesn't allow you to do that."

I asked questions to my peers, stayed on task, and worked outside of school(during break a lot). I may have not got everything done, but its good to know that I tried and gave my full effort.\n",
