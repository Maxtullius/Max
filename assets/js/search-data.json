We will have different genres represented by diferent html tabs at the top of our blog. When these are clicked there will be links to the different posts. These posts will be different artists and there will be a paragraph to describe them. Then we will put some of the most popular songs by these artist. We wil also add who these artists are similar to and what songs are similar to each other. Outline . | We will begin with creating the html tabs of the different genres. We will be doing, rap, rock, country, and pop. We will add the history of this genre and what it sounds like. There will be a summery of why someone might like it. | We will then create the posts of the artists. We will make sure to add at least 5 artists to each genre. We wil add their backstory and what their music sounds like. we will also add what other artists they sound like. | Then we will ads the songs of each of these artists. 5 songs per artist. A total of 100 songs will be added. We will also right similar songs t these. College Board Criteria . | Row 1: Program Purpose and Function. The purpose of the website will be to create a playlist. The functin will be different posts create and html tabs that are linked to these. | Row 2: Data Abstraction. We will be able to explain the variables of artists, songs, and genres. | Row 3: Managing Complexity. If we run into problems we will ask each other questions. | Row 4: Procedural Abstraction. We will understand our process nd manage our time well. | Row 5: Algorithm Implementation. Organizign by genre, artist, and songs will show this. | Row 6: Testing. Testing will occur after we create the webstie. We will make sure every page is running well. | .",

What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99 } total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) total= menu[item] #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(total) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 3.99 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding.
