            "content": "Take some additional notes that you would like here for 3.12 and 3.13. We will be looking for additional notes from the presentation. . What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: are input values of a procedure. . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality . Procedural Abstraction: rovides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. . What are some other names for procedures?: method or function depending on the language . Why are procedures effective?: We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): bin = &quot;&quot; i = 7 while i &gt;= 0: if n % (2**i) == n: bin = bin + &quot;0&quot; i -= 1 else: bin = bin + &quot;1&quot; n -= 2**i i -= 1 print(bin) convertToBinary(decimal) . 00000111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . num1 = 6 num2 = 7 function findMax(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &gt; numberB) { console.log(numberA + &quot; is max&quot;) } else { console.log(numberB + &quot; is max&quot;) } } function findMin(numberA, numberB) { if (numberA &lt; numberB) { console.log(numberA + &quot; is min&quot;) } else { console.log(numberB + &quot; is min&quot;) } } findMax(num1, num2) findMin(num1,num2) . Input In [7] function findMax(numberA, numberB) { ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . string = &quot;APCSP&quot; up = [&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;G&quot;,&quot;H&quot;,&quot;I&quot;,&quot;J&quot;,&quot;K&quot;,&quot;L&quot;,&quot;M&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,&quot;O&quot;,&quot;P&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;,&quot;R&quot;,&quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot;,&quot;U&quot;,&quot;V&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;Z&quot;] low = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot;,&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;l&quot;,&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;o&quot;,&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;r&quot;,&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;,&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;,&quot;w&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;] declist = [] binlist = [] def charToBinary(x): for y in up: if x == y: declist.append((up.index(x)) + 65) for z in low: if x == z: declist.append((low.index(x)) + 97) def convert(dec): bin = &quot;&quot; i = 7 while i &gt;= 0: if dec % (2**i) == dec: bin = bin + &quot;0&quot; i -= 1 else: bin = bin + &quot;1&quot; dec -= 2**i i -= 1 binlist.append(bin) for ch1 in string: charToBinary(ch1) for decimal in declist: convert(decimal) print(binlist) .

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

The main difference between simulations and experiments is that simulations replicate real world scenarios digitally while experiments are held in the real world | Simulations usually are less expensive than running an experiment because the expenses needed for acquiring equipment are not present when running a simulation | Since experiments and done in the real world, they provide actual results while simulations use models based on collected data to provide estimations of what is expected to happen | Simulations can provide estimations for events that can&#39;t be recreated in the real world because simulations don&#39;t run the risk of safety issues and they can be done without equipment that would be needed for experimentation | Once created, simulations are easier to repeat to obtain more estimations when compared to experiments because experiments often take a long time to set up and execute | Simulation are a way to simulate real-world environments to test safety or logistics.

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import random random_number = random.randint(1, 10) print(random_number) . 6 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing package which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | Returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x | . floor() | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | The number whose factorial has to be computed. | . gcd | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | least common multiple | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . import math num1 = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;)) num2 = int(input(&quot;Enter another number: &quot;)) round_up1 = math.ceil(num1) round_up2 = math.ceil(num2) round_down1 = math.floor(num1) round_down2 = math.floor(num2) result = math.log(num1, num2) print(&quot;Round up: {} and {}&quot;.format(round_up1, round_up2)) print(&quot;Round down: {} and {}&quot;.format(round_down1, round_down2)) . Round up: 6 and 4 Round down: 6 and 4 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . import datetime from random import randint date1 = datetime.date(randint(2000, 2020), randint(1, 12), randint(1, 28)) date2 = datetime.date(randint(2000, 2020), randint(1, 12), randint(1, 28)) difference = date2 - date1 print(difference.days) . -2295 .",

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Once you&#39;ve done this with one of the types of loops discussed in this lesson, create a function that does the same thing with a different type of loop. . binarylist = [ &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot; ] newlist = [] def binary_convert(binary): dec = 0 i = 7 for num in str(binary): if int(num) == 1: dec += 2**i i -= 1 continue else: i -= 1 continue newlist.append(dec) for x in binarylist: binary_convert(x) print(newlist) i = 0 while i &lt; len(newlist): if int(newlist[i]) &gt; 100: newlist.pop(i) i += 1 print(newlist) .

We will have different genres represented by diferent html tabs at the top of our blog. When these are clicked there will be links to the different posts. These posts will be different artists and there will be a paragraph to describe them. Then we will put some of the most popular songs by these artist. We wil also add who these artists are similar to and what songs are similar to each other. Outline . | We will begin with creating the html tabs of the different genres. We will be doing, rap, rock, country, and pop. We will add the history of this genre and what it sounds like. There will be a summery of why someone might like it. | We will then create the posts of the artists. We will make sure to add at least 5 artists to each genre. We wil add their backstory and what their music sounds like. we will also add what other artists they sound like. | Then we will ads the songs of each of these artists. 5 songs per artist. A total of 100 songs will be added. We will also right similar songs t these. College Board Criteria . | Row 1: Program Purpose and Function. The purpose of the website will be to create a playlist. The functin will be different posts create and html tabs that are linked to these. | Row 2: Data Abstraction. We will be able to explain the variables of artists, songs, and genres. | Row 3: Managing Complexity. If we run into problems we will ask each other questions. | Row 4: Procedural Abstraction. We will understand our process nd manage our time well. | Row 5: Algorithm Implementation. Organizign by genre, artist, and songs will show this. | Row 6: Testing. Testing will occur after we create the webstie. We will make sure every page is running well. | .",

Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99 } total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) total= menu[item] #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(total) .
