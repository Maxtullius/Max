# Project Plan
## Main Function 
- Our final project will be a website that will be a webstie that will be a website that will help people create music playlists. We will have different genres represented by diferent html tabs at the top of our blog. When these are clicked there will be links to the different posts. These posts will be different artists and there will be a paragraph to describe them. Then we will put some of the most popular songs by these artist. We wil also add who these artists are similar to and what songs are similar to each other.
## Outline
